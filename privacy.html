              <p><strong>Last updated: May 2018</strong></p>
              <p><a href="datenschutz.html">German privacy policy (Datenschutzerklärung)</a></p>
              <p>Please note: This is a shortened version of our complete privacy policy. Please refer to the German Privacy Policy for more details.</p>

              <p>Frank Duffner, including its affiliates (“DT games”), collects, stores, and uses your personal information in connection with and in order to provide and develop COMP_NAME products, desktop and mobile applications, services, and websites (together “Services”) according to this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).</p>

              <p>All DT games Services are governed by this Privacy Policy. By using or accessing a DT games Service you give your consent to the processing, use, and disclosure of your collected data. Please do not install or use any DT games Services if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

              <p>DT games reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of Services will signify your acceptance of the changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>

              <h3>What do we do with your data?</h3>
              <p>Thanks to collected data, we can better understand how our Services are being used. This helps us make well-informed decisions about the future of our Services. To that end, we only use personal data if it's absolutely necessary, for example when we are in direct contact with you.</p>

              <h4>E-Mail</h4>
              <p>If you contact us by e-mail, we will hold on to your e-mail address to enable continued communication.</p>

              <h4>Website</h4>
              <p>To deliver a website or other online content to you, we need to collect personal data such as the type of your browser and your IP address. Without this information, we do not know where to send the online content. This data will be saved in log files but will not be used for any other purposes.</p>

              <p>We may also need to save cookies on your device to make the use of our services possible. Cookies are small files that allow our services to identify you and provide the appropriate information.</p>

              <p>However, to deliver third-party online content, such as YouTube videos, this information needs to be transmitted to these third parties. While we do our best to only work with partners that do not abuse this information, we are not liable for their actions.</p>
<!--
              <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
              <p>Our Services use Google Analytics, an analytics service of Google Inc. („Google“). Google Analytics uses so-called „Cookies“, text files that are saved on the user's computer to allow their use of our Services. The information generated by the user's interaction with the Service and the cookie will usually be sent to and saved on a server owned by Google in the USA. We take all available measures to only collect anonymized data. For example, the IP of a user will be anonymized, meaning it is usually only saved in a shortened and unidentifiable form.</p>

              <h3>Mailchimp Newsletter</h3>
              <p>Our newsletter is delivered by MailChimp. This service makes use of your e-mail address to deliver messages. You can supply your name, birth date, and gender as optional information. You can also unsubscribe at any time.</p>
